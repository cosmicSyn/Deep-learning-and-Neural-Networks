# Deep Learning Repository

## Problem
- The goal of this repository is to showcase my implementations of deep neural networks for various tasks, including a basic deep neural network, logistic regression using deep neural networks, and an image classification model.

## Approach
- Employed Python and NumPy for the implementation of deep learning algorithms.
- Utilized popular deep learning concepts for solving specific tasks.

## Implementation

### 1. Deep Neural Network from Scratch
- Implemented a basic deep neural network to understand the fundamentals.
- File: `deep_neural_network.py`

### 2. Logistic Regression using Deep Neural Network
- Extended the basic deep neural network to perform logistic regression.
- File: `logistic_regression_with_deep_nn.py`

### 3. Image Classification using Deep Neural Network
- Developed an image classification model using a deep neural network.
- File: `image_classification_deep_nn.py`

## Usage
- Each Python file can be run independently to see the implementation and results.
- Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.

## Dependencies
- Python
- NumPy

I recognize the time people spend on building intuition, understanding new concepts and debugging assignments. The solutions uploaded here are **only for reference**. They are meant to unblock you if you get stuck somewhere. Please do not copy any part of the code as-is (the programming assignments are fairly easy if you read the instructions carefully). Similarly, try out the quizzes yourself before you refer to the quiz solutions. This course is the most straight-forward deep learning course I have ever taken, with fabulous course content and structure. It's a treasure by the deeplearning.ai team.
